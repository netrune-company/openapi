# OpenAPI Schema

### A serializable struct for representing an OpenAPI schema

> **Note:** As of 0.0.1, this crate simply re-exports the crate [openapiv3](https://crates.io/crates/openapiv3). This crate is not supposed to be used by external crates. However, the plan may be to move away from this re-export at some point in the future.
